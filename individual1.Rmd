# Lab 2
### Problem 1
The distribution of the ratings are between 1 and 4, with a majority of ratings bettween 2.5 and 3.5. There do appear to be a couple of outliers with a rating between 1 and 1.5.


```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating)
```

### Problem 2
From the scatterplot above, there does not appear to be a trend bewteen cacao percent and rating, so ratings are not dependent on the cacao percent.
